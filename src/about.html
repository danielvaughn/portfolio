                    Originally an artist and designer, I began my career transition towards software development in 2012. My background gave me a solid foundation in design thinking, and I try to carry that attention to detail to my code. Below is a selection of my most recent and notable work.

                    <p>The TradeIt product lets app developers, publishers, and ETF companies integrate any major US retail brokerâ€™s functionality into any app, site, or platform.</p>
                    <p>I helped build and maintain a java-based web API that connects with most major US retail brokers to handle authentication, order management and portfolio management.</p>
                    <p>You can read about the API on their <a href="https://www.trade.it/documentation/api">documentation page</a></p>

                    <p>In addition to providing an API, TradeIt allows publishers to integrate order and portfolio management functionality directly onto their site using pre-built widgets.</p>

                    <p>I helped build and maintain both the widgets and the client library used to connect to the TradeIt API.</p>

                    <p>I built and maintained TradeIt's iOS SDK, which allows publishers to integrate order and portfolio management functionality directly into their app with only a few lines of code.</p>

                    <p>The SDK is currently integrated into several apps, including <a target="_blank" href="https://rubicoin.com/">Rubicoin</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stock-master-stocks-market/id591644846">StockMaster</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stocks-live-portfolio-manager/id473206441">StocksLive</a>.</p>
