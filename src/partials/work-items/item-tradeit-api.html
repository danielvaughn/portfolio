        <p>The TradeIt product lets app developers, publishers, and ETF companies integrate any major US retail brokerâ€™s functionality into any app, site, or platform.</p>
        <p>I helped build and maintain a java-based web API that connects with most major US retail brokers to handle authentication, order management and portfolio management.</p>
